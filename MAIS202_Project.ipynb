Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our, our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal. We\\u2019re committed to maintaining our economy\\u2019s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. To that end, today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by \\u00bc percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I\\u2019ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a\\u2014at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next few years. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September. Thereafter, the median projection falls to our 2 percent objective. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate. At today\\u2019s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by \\u00bc percentage point, to 4\\u00bc-4\\u00bd percent. We\\u2019ve been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing further progress in\\u2014sorry, enabling further progress on\\u2014inflation. With today\\u2019s action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We\\u2019re not on any preset course. In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2026. These median projections are somewhat higher than in September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection. These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate\\u2014its typical configuration. Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jeanna. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME> with the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it\\u2019s appropriate to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year. And what would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like? Would a January cut potentially be possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Well, so let, let me start by saying why we\\u2014why we cut today and then\\u2014and then move to 2025. So I would say today was a\\u2014was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability. We see the risks as two-sided: moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we\\u2019re trying to steer between those two risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. And I, I\\u2019ll give you some details on why. Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic, and it\\u2019s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and orderly way. We don\\u2019t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2 percent. Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures\\u2014such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that\\u2014broadly show a, a much cooler labor market than there was, than we had in 2019. It\\u2019s still quite gradually cooling. So we, we keep an eye on that. Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I\\u2019ll tell you why. We, we\\u2019ve made a great deal of progress. Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent. Twelve\\u2014but 12-month inflation has actually been moving sideways, as we are \\u201clapping\\u201d very low readings of late last year. Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped. And we, we\\u2019ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for goods. So I\\u2019ll just say, we, we\\u2014so remember that we couple this decision today with the \\u201cextent and timing\\u201d language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments. You ask about 2025. I, I think that the lower\\u2014the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we\\u2019ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher. You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut. I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today. We\\u2019re, we\\u2019re going to react to data. That\\u2019s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks is likely to be appropriate. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you make those cuts? Like, what would\\u2014what would be the trigger to cut? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we\\u2019re\\u2014to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this way: We\\u2019ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points. We\\u2019re significantly closer to neutral. At 4.3 percent and \\u201cchange,\\u201d we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive. But as for additional cuts, we\\u2019re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market. And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious about\\u2014as we consider further cuts. And all of that is reflected\\u2014to your question\\u2014in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next year, compared to four in September. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Howard. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME> with Reuters, and thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question. So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year. Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal. What\\u2019s the split on this one? How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in, and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I, I\\u2019d say\\u2014I\\u2019d, I\\u2019d point to five or six things, and, and I\\u2019d start\\u2014let me start by saying that we think the economy\\u2019s in a really good place, and we think policy\\u2019s in a really good place. Let\\u2019s remember that the economy\\u2019s growing 2\\u00bd percent this year, that inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to\\u2014from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Headline inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis. We\\u2019re actually in a really good starting place here. But since, you know\\u2014so, so what\\u2019s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path? First thing is growth is stronger, right? We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next year as well. Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you\\u2019ll see that participants think that the\\u2014that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. And so that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s more strength, right? Inflation is higher, as we talked about. Inflation\\u2019s higher this year. It\\u2019s also higher in the forecast next year. I\\u2019d also point out that we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason to be cautious about, about further moves. And\\u2014but then getting to your\\u2014to your point, there\\u2019s also, there\\u2019s uncertainty\\u2014uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher. It\\u2019s also\\u2014it\\u2019s also, in the case of some people, some people\\u2014the way I\\u2019d say it is this: Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting. Some people said they didn\\u2019t do so, and some people didn\\u2019t, didn\\u2019t say whether they did or not. So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that. But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation. And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it\\u2019s kind of commonsense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower. It\\u2019s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. And so that may have affected some of the people. But as, as I said, there\\u2019s a range of\\u2014range of approaches on the Committee. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document. The upside risk to inflation jumped quite substantially. The only thing, really, that\\u2019s happened\\u2014you, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside. The only real thing that\\u2019s happened is November 5th, in the meantime. Is it fair to say that that\\u2019s what\\u2019s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Actually, that\\u2019s not the only thing that\\u2019s happened. What\\u2019s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in September. So, you\\u2019ve got\\u2014you had two months of higher inflation, September and October. As I mentioned, November is, is back on track. But, you know, once again we\\u2019ve, you know, we\\u2019ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it\\u2019s kind of fallen apart as we\\u2019ve approached the end of the year. So that is certainly a large factor in people\\u2019s thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations. It\\u2019s still, you know, going to be between 2\\u00bd and 3 [percent]. It\\u2019s way below where it was. But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we\\u2019re going to be looking for progress on inflation. We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves. That\\u2019s in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, as we go forward, we\\u2019re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping a solid labor market. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Chris. <NAME>CHRIS RUGABER</NAME>. Thank you. <NAME>CHRIS RUGABER</NAME> at Associated Press. Thanks for taking the question. In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of \\u201clooking through\\u201d any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations remained anchored. Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other thinking on tariffs generally that you can share? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative simulations are a good place to start. I happened to have brought them here with me today. I\\u2019m sure you have them too. They\\u2019re, they\\u2019re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you know, it\\u2019s six-years-old analysis. But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right questions to ask. And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was\\u2014one was \\u201cseeing through,\\u201d one was not. And I point you to, you\\u2019ll\\u2014 there\\u2019s some language in the\\u2014in the \\u201csee- through\\u201d paragraph. It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to \\u201csee through\\u201d inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not be. In any case, this is not a question that\\u2019s in front of us right now. We, we won\\u2019t face that question\\u2014we don\\u2019t know when we\\u2019ll face that question. What the Committee\\u2019s doing now is, is discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can affect\\u2014tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that. So, we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re\\u2014we\\u2019ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make, you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response. <NAME>CHRIS RUGABER</NAME>. Great, and just a quick follow[-up]. Do you, given the recent bout of inflation that we\\u2019ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and businesses being\\u2014seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a little bit riskier to look through tariffs? I mean, are\\u2014do you feel that you have to respond more quickly to inflation threats, given what we\\u2019ve seen the past few years? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So the, the main thing is\\u2014and this is also a point in these alternative simulations\\u2014is that there\\u2019re just many, many factors that go into what, what\\u2014how much tariffs will, will even go into consumer inflation. How persistent will that be? And, you know, so, we just\\u2014we just don\\u2019t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it\\u2019s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don\\u2019t know what\\u2019ll be tariffed, from what countries, for how long, and what size. We don\\u2019t know whether there\\u2019ll be, you know, retaliatory tariffs. We don\\u2019t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices. To your\\u2014to your point as well, I don\\u2019t\\u2014I wouldn\\u2019t say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we\\u2019ve just been through a period of high inflation. We\\u2019ve just gotten through that period. That\\u2019s a difference. It was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may\\u2014that may have affects. I don\\u2019t know. I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a very careful assessment, but only when we\\u2019ve actually seen what the policies are and how they\\u2019re implemented. And, you know, we\\u2019re just\\u2014we\\u2019re just not at that stage. We\\u2019re at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing\\u2014which is kind of thinking about these questions, but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Nick. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>, the Wall Street Journal. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>, to make sure I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for \\u201925 so that the central tendency runs from 2\\u00bd to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside. So if inflation only declines next year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Let me\\u2014let me find these numbers. So we have\\u2014we have inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to 2\\u00bd [percent] next year. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019d be\\u2014that\\u2019d be significant progress. You see a slower path. I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress. But we, we, you know, we\\u2019d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level. That wouldn\\u2019t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you know, better than this year. This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9. That would be meaningful. We, we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market. And while we, we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way. But it\\u2019s also something we need to keep our eye on. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these projections and also the insertion of the \\u201cextent and timing\\u201d language in the statement, which has been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it\\u2019s going to be on hold for a while, and they said, \\u201cGee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,\\u201d would they be mistaken to, to infer that? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s not the\\u2014that\\u2019s not any decision that we\\u2019ve made at all. Let me explain \\u201cextent and timing.\\u201d So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we\\u2019re at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts. So \\u201cextent,\\u201d that just relates to how, how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance. Clearly, that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points. So it\\u2019s significantly smaller. So that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s the \\u201cextent\\u201d question. And, again, we\\u2019re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor market, to make those cuts. \\u201cTiming\\u201d just suggests, again, that we\\u2019re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we\\u2019re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments. So that, that\\u2019s what we mean by that. We\\u2019re not trying to make decisions about the longer run. You know, we are, we\\u2019re trying to make sensible policy as we go. And, you know, I just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it\\u2019s just\\u2014it\\u2019s just a function of the fact that, that we expect significant policy changes. There\\u2019s nothing really unusual about that. I think we need to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We\\u2019ll, we\\u2019ll have a much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Mike. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME> from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Even though you\\u2019ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven\\u2019t seen much change in mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates. You say you\\u2019re significantly restrictive. Are you running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of a slowdown than you anticipate? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So the, the risks that you\\u2014sorry, the rates that you talked about are, are really longer-run rates, and they\\u2019re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they\\u2019re also affected by many other things. And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short-term rates do. So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions, and then we look at what\\u2019s happening in the economy. So what we see happening in the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth for a very long time, and it keeps not happening. So we have\\u2014we\\u2019re now well into another year of growth. It looks like it might be 2\\u00bd percent. Third and\\u2014second and third quarters were right about at the same level. So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well. Substantially better than our global peer group. And I, I\\u2014there\\u2019s no reason to think a downturn is, is any more likely than it\\u2014than it usually is. So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy. We have to stay on task, though, and continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent. We\\u2019re also going to be looking out for the labor market. We want to keep the labor market pretty close to where it is. We\\u2019re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment. Job creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close. And so that\\u2019s what our policy\\u2019s trying to achieve. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. If I could follow up by asking about\\u2014your formulation for beginning rate cuts included the phrase \\u201cwe need to have confidence that inflation is moving down towards our target.\\u201d Given the fact that you\\u2019ve raised your forecast for next year, do you have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we\\u2019ve made\\u2014look, look at the broader suite: We\\u2019ve made just a great deal of progress. We\\u2019re, you know, we\\u2019re well into the 2\\u2019s in, in core inflation and around 2\\u00bd [percent]\\u2014or even lower than that, we have been\\u2014for headline inflation. So I, I would say I\\u2019m confident that inflation has come down a great deal, and I, I\\u2019m confident in the story about why it\\u2019s come down and why that portends well. And I\\u2019ll\\u2014and I\\u2019ll tell you why. You, again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we\\u2019ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it\\u2019s nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate better with, you know, new leases that turn over. Not, not new tenants, but new leases. Market rents is new leases. So that, that\\u2019s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect. Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic. Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that. But we think, overall, that should generally be in the range it was in. Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are in, in good shape. It\\u2019s nonmarket services, and those are\\u2014those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly, and they, they don\\u2019t, we, we think they don\\u2019t really tell us much about the, you know, about tightness in the economy. They don\\u2019t really reflect that. I mean, a good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just\\u2014so that, that\\u2019s how that inflation works. So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact. In particular, the labor market\\u2014look at the labor market. It\\u2019s, it is cooler by so many measures now\\u2014modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent. So it\\u2019s not a source of inflationary pressures. Not to say there aren\\u2019t regional and, and, you know, particular professions where labor is tight. But, overall, you\\u2019re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market. So what\\u2019s the story? The story is still just, we\\u2019re unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and \\u201922 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance. It\\u2019s real inflation, but it doesn\\u2019t portend persistently high inflation. So we and most other forecasters still feel that we\\u2019re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent. It might take another year or two from here, but I, I\\u2019m confident that that\\u2019s the path we\\u2019re on. And, you know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Colby. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME>. Thank you. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME> with the Financial Times. So the unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the 50 basis point cut in September. Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors. But now the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings. So what has changed about the Committee\\u2019s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market? Is there just less concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now needs to be accounted for? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. The, the unemployment rate has now\\u2014is now the same as it was in July: 4.2 percent. It\\u2019s moved up and down, but it\\u2019s now the same as July. And job creation is, is lower than it has been, but it\\u2019s been\\u2014it\\u2019s been steady\\u2014it\\u2019s not\\u2014it\\u2019s not declining. It\\u2019s been steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it\\u2019s not so far below. So, you might\\u2014you might\\u2014if, if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue\\u2014job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing. So gradually declining. But we don\\u2019t have that kind of precision in this. So, but you\\u2019re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons. We, we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we\\u2019re watching that closely. It\\u2019s, it\\u2019s not cooling in a\\u2014in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think, you know, you pointed out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative to the labor market. And it\\u2019s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it doesn\\u2019t\\u2014the unemployment rate flat and things like that. Nonetheless, you know, we\\u2019re watching it closely. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME>. If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the labor market is welcome here, what\\u2019s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I\\u2014what I said is, we don\\u2019t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying, not that it\\u2019s not welcome. We don\\u2019t need it, we don\\u2019t think. If, if you had a situation where inflation\\u2019s moving around by a tenth every few months, that\\u2019s, you know, we\\u2019d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12-month window. And so we\\u2019ve got to weigh them both, at this point. You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused on, on inflation. We\\u2019ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we think are broadly, roughly in balance. And so that\\u2019s how we think about it. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Steve. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word \\u201crecalibration\\u201d today. And I\\u2019m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it was before. Thanks. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019re not\\u2014we\\u2019re not renaming the phase\\u2014yet. But we may get around to that. But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I said. So, and that\\u2019s just because we\\u2019ve reduced\\u2014we\\u2019ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points. We\\u2019re significantly closer to neutral. We still think where we are is meaningfully, meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it\\u2019s appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation. We\\u2019ve, you know, we\\u2019ve done a lot to support economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that\\u2019s a good thing. I, I think it would\\u2014I support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make. I think from now we are in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation. And that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s how we\\u2019re thinking about it. So it is kind of a new thing. We moved pretty quickly to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we\\u2019re going to be moving slower, which is consistent with, with the SEP. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we\\u2019ve had in the recent inflation numbers. For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the avian flu, that, that kind of stuff. And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation coming down, as it did in the recent report. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the numbers we don\\u2019t like, you know? It\\u2019s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], \\u201cLook, those high months are wrong.\\u201d What about the low months? You know, we\\u2019ve got, we have a very low month, potentially, in November. You know, it\\u2019s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens for core PCE. So that could be idiosyncratically low. We try to look\\u2014we try to look at not just a couple or three months. We shouldn\\u2019t have\\u2014our, our position shouldn\\u2019t change based on two or three months of good or bad data. We have a long string now of inflation coming down gradually over time. As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it\\u2019s 12-month headline\\u2019s 2\\u00bd; 12-month core is 2.8. That\\u2019s way better than we were. We still have some work to do, though, is how we\\u2019re looking at it. And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get\\u2014to get that work done, we think. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Neil. <NAME>NEIL IRWIN</NAME>. Thanks Chair, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>NEIL IRWIN</NAME> from Axios. Financial markets have been very buoyant, really all year. Is the Committee comfortable with where financial conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine progress on your inflation target? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that\\u2019s part of what we do. But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our\\u2014 of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy. So what we\\u2019ve seen over the course of\\u2014just take the last year. We, we\\u2019ve seen inflation\\u2014well, over the last couple of years\\u2014come down a lot. We\\u2019ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit. That suggests that our policy is restrictive. We\\u2019ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected by\\u2014that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing. Housing activity is, is very low, and that\\u2019s partly, significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working. It\\u2019s transmitting, and it\\u2019s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want. You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don\\u2019t really control those. But I\\u2019d say we, we see the effects we\\u2019re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the places where we\\u2019d expect to see it. <NAME>NEIL IRWIN</NAME>. So, if I may, speaking of assets that have\\u2014that have been buoyant, do you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, you know, we, we\\u2019re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re not looking for a, a law change. That\\u2019s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Andrew. <NAME>ANDREW ACKERMAN</NAME>. Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for taking our questions. I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you\\u2019re confident that we\\u2019ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years ago. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I think it\\u2019s pretty clear we\\u2019ve avoided a recession. I think growth this year has, has been solid, it really has. PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real growth] this year. This is a really good number. Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable. And it\\u2019s\\u2014when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the story, is that how well the U.S. is doing. And if you look around the world, there\\u2019s just a lot of slow growth and continued struggles with inflation. So I feel\\u2014I feel very good about where the economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going. <NAME>ANDREW ACKERMAN</NAME>. The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the\\u2014you, you guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low. However, employment rates have fallen rather quickly. The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point\\u2014half a percent, rather\\u2014recently. The question, I guess, is, do you think there\\u2019s maybe more downside momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I don\\u2019t think so, no. I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age participation is still very high. What, what\\u2019s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low. So if you\\u2014if you have a job, you\\u2019re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right? So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers. If you are looking for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that\\u2019s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come down. So we look for signs like that, and that, that\\u2019s clearly a sign of softening, further softening. I didn\\u2019t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in the labor market. Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation. And, you know, that\\u2019s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the action, with, with an additional cut. So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is very low\\u2014again, participation is high. Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable level\\u2014wage growth. And so the labor market\\u2014this is a good, a good labor market, and, you know, we want to keep it that way. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Amara. <NAME>AMARA OMEOKWE</NAME>. Thank you. <NAME>AMARA OMEOKWE</NAME> from Bloomberg News. I just want to put a finer point on the labor market. Can you keep the labor market this way, in the strong position that you have described, without further cuts? In other words, do you still view the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know, we, we can\\u2019t know that with any tremendous certainty. I, I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks\\u2014we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape. And when I say it\\u2019s softening or cooling, it\\u2019s very gradual process. You know, job creations are, are meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend. If you, if you take into account the high productivity readings we\\u2019ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent inflation. So, again, I, I don\\u2019t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished. Nonetheless, it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s one of our mandate goals, and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s worth noting that it is still gradually cooling\\u2014gradually and in an orderly way. And, and, you know, that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s how I would characterize it, and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re paying careful attention. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Elizabeth. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME>. Thanks so much, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME> from ABC News. As you\\u2019ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year. High prices are still a burden for so many households right now. Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you\\u2019d expected? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it just has been a little bit more stubborn. I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would\\u2019ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you know, high unemployment by now. Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path down has actually been much better than many predicted. We, we\\u2019ve managed to, to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come down from\\u2014you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a 12-month basis. So that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s a pretty good outcome. Why hasn\\u2019t it come down [more]? One reason is that, that\\u2014just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than\\u2014market rents have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two years ago. So that\\u2019s part of it. I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the\\u2014what, what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we, we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that. And it\\u2019s prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that. So there\\u2019s tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have\\u2014inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices, and that is\\u2014that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them\\u2014and that\\u2019s who we work for\\u2014is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year. And that\\u2019s what will restore people\\u2019s good feeling about the economy. That\\u2019s what it will take, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re aiming for. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME>. And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I feel\\u2014I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly, I\\u2019m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it\\u2019s\\u2014we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re in a really good place; our policy\\u2019s in a really good place. I, I expect another good year next year. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Edward. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. Thanks, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>, for doing the questions. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME> from Fox Business. So you say that we\\u2019re closer to the neutral rate. What percent do you see, and the Committee believes\\u2014where is that neutral rate? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I\\u2019ll say a couple things. First of all, when we, when we write\\u2014 the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy\\u2019s in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now. So when we\\u2019re making monetary policy at the Fed, that\\u2019s not the question we\\u2019re asking. So you can\\u2019t do a straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the appropriate policy should be. So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the economy. And so what we\\u2019re doing in, in real time is we\\u2019re looking at our policy stance, and we\\u2019re looking at the way it\\u2019s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it\\u2019s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability. And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are\\u2014that are lasting but not permanent. And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*. The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually affect what, what\\u2019s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we\\u2019re looking at that, and, you know, we don\\u2019t\\u2014we don\\u2019t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say, we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we\\u2019re 100 basis points closer to it right now. There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we\\u2019re a lot closer to it, and I think we\\u2019re in a good place. But I think from here it\\u2019s a new phase, and we\\u2019re going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little more clarity. I mean, I\\u2019ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent. You know, I, I think the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, I mean, honestly, we\\u2014you know, there are countless models of what\\u2014of what a neutral rate might be at any given time. There, there are empirical models, there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you\\u2019d like. So there is no real certainty. And, I mean, it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s actually a good thing to know that we don\\u2019t know exactly where it is, so you\\u2019re not\\u2014you\\u2019re not tempted to think, \\u201cOh, I think this model or this estimate is right.\\u201d You, you just have to be open to, you know, the empirical data that are coming in and also how it\\u2019s affecting the outlook. And it\\u2019s not made any easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags. Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re\\u2014 I think we need\\u2014 it\\u2019s appropriate for us\\u2014for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we\\u2019re 100 basis points closer to, to neutral, and we\\u2019ll do so. Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Victoria. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME> with Politico. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation. Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up? And then also, since that\\u2019s what\\u2019s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that? Why, why do you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation, because that\\u2019s what people experience. People don\\u2019t experience core inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs. So that\\u2019s the overall goal. But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation. So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is. So we look at core inflation because it\\u2019s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it\\u2019s a better measure of, of what inflation pressures exist. So that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s\\u2014it\\u2019s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know, our goal is headline, not core. So your question was, your second question was what? <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially ticking up? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So headline can be affected\\u2014you\\u2019re talking about next year. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Mm-hmm. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices. So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be\\u2014if, if you look at core going out a full year, then it\\u2019ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy. So it\\u2014that, that\\u2019s why the two can go in different directions. Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year, but that\\u2019s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people. But energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won\\u2019t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you\\u2019re thinking about energy prices? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know, but\\u2014really carefully, rather. But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven\\u2019t really\\u2014 nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States economy. The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we\\u2019re talking about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and\\u2014but that, that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil. But the price of oil\\u2019s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions. So we don\\u2019t\\u2014the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly, at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil. And it remains, you know, a risk. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Kelly. KELLY O\\u2019GRADY. Thanks, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Kelly O\\u2019Grady from CBS News. I want to go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now. It wasn\\u2019t the case for some time, of course. It\\u2019s partly why Americans haven\\u2019t felt much relief in their wallets from prices yet. But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in closing that gap could go away? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, so inflation\\u2014again, we don\\u2019t overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings. And we, what we had was\\u2014we had four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then November is much lower. So I don\\u2019t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation. I, I think inflation is much lower. What the public is feeling, and they\\u2019re right about it, is that prices are, are just\\u2014the price level went up, because of the past inflation. It is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your, your real compensation is growing. And, in other words, your compensation\\u2019s growing meaningfully faster than inflation. That\\u2019s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just want to hold onto it. That, that process will probably take some years, but that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s going on right now. And I don\\u2019t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that, anything of the nature you\\u2019re suggesting. KELLY O\\u2019GRADY. And just one follow-up: Let\\u2019s look more long-term. You previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026. It\\u2019s now been pushed out to 2027. You said you\\u2019re focused on enabling further progress on inflation. That\\u2019s not necessarily progress in the right direction. Are you confident that target isn\\u2019t going to move further out? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019re talking about\\u2014when you\\u2019re projecting the economy, you know, three years out, two years out, you\\u2019re talking about high uncertainty. Very high uncertainty. You know, we, we really\\u2014at that point it, it\\u2019s not, it\\u2019s not possible to confidently predict where the economy is going to be in three years. So what we\\u2019re doing is we\\u2019re looking at what\\u2019s happening now. And we\\u2019re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening\\u2014so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods and services\\u2014goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their, their prior level. All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces come together. There\\u2019s every reason to think that they will. The timing of it is highly uncertain. You know, but you\\u2019re not wrong, though, that, you know, we\\u2019ve, the\\u2014 it\\u2019s been a bit frustrating because the\\u2014while we\\u2019ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped. Nonetheless, we\\u2019re still on track. And, you know, I think if you\\u2019d\\u2014if two, two years ago, you\\u2019d said, \\u201cwe were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,\\u201d people would be, would say, \\u201cI\\u2019ll take that.\\u201d I mean, that, that\\u2019s a pretty good interim place to be. Job\\u2019s not done, but, but I think we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re feeling good about where we are and where we\\u2019re headed. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Go to Nancy for the last question. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-GENZER. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-Genzer from Marketplace. You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways. You know, it appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2\\u00bd percent. Do you think the Fed is just going to have to settle for that and accept that you\\u2019re not going to get to your 2 percent target? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, we\\u2019re not going to settle for that. I think we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re, you know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we\\u2019ll get inflation back sustainably to 2 percent. That is\\u2014and I am confident we will achieve that. It has taken longer, but it\\u2019s, you have to be\\u2014you know, we are making progress. We have made a great deal of progress. And we\\u2019ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation. That\\u2019s what we owe the public. And, and, you know, we\\u2019re committed to achieving it. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-GENZER. In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You don\\u2019t rule things completely in or out in this\\u2014in this world. That doesn\\u2019t appear to be a likely outcome. I think we\\u2019re at 4.3 percent. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019s meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it\\u2019s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market. So\\u2014Thank you very much.\",\n          \"<NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That\\u2019s very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we\\u2019re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past two years, we\\u2019ve significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we\\u2019ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy\\u2014 about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome. But we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed\\u2019s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\\u2019re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we\\u2019re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5\\u00bc percentage points, and we\\u2019ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today\\u2019s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5\\u00bc to 5\\u00bd percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We\\u2019re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we\\u2019ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-run\\u2014longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jeanna. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME> from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don\\u2019t want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming\\u2014coming down fully. I wonder\\u2014what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? And as you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you\\u2019ve been seeing? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Sorry\\u2014say that last part again. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. How are\\u2014how are you weighing the growth data and consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We\\u2019re\\u2014we\\u2019re looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019re looking for better data. It\\u2019s\\u2014we\\u2019re looking at continuation of the good data that we\\u2019ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that six months of good inflation data\\u2014is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path\\u2014a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation? That\\u2019s the question. And the answer will come from some more data that\\u2019s also good data. It doesn\\u2019t\\u2014it\\u2019s not that the six-month data isn\\u2019t\\u2014isn\\u2019t low enough. It is. It\\u2019s just a question of, can we take that with confidence that we\\u2019re moving sustainably down to 2 percent? That\\u2019s really what we\\u2019re thinking about. In terms of, of growth, we\\u2019ve had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we\\u2019ve had strong growth\\u2014very strong growth [in real GDP] last year\\u2014going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we\\u2019ve had a very strong labor market, and we\\u2019ve had inflation coming down. So I think\\u2014whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity\\u2014that hasn\\u2019t been the case. So I think we, we look at\\u2014we look at stronger growth. We don\\u2019t look at it as a problem. I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We\\u2019re not looking for a weaker labor market. We\\u2019re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. And I\\u2019m sorry. If I could just follow up very quickly, the\\u2014when, when you say that you want to make sure that it\\u2019s a true signal, is there anything that you\\u2019re seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it\\u2019s a true signal at this stage? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, I think it\\u2019s\\u2014I, I would say it, it seems\\u2014it seems to be the likely case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven\\u2019t yet. And so\\u2014I mean, it\\u2019s a good story. We have six months of good inflation [readings]. But you can\\u2014and you know this\\u2014you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it\\u2019s been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative. It\\u2019s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out\\u2014probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number\\u2014not so much the composition. But we, we just need to see more. That\\u2019s where we are, as a Committee. We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms what we think we\\u2019re seeing and that tells us that we are on\\u2014gives us confidence that we\\u2019re on, on a path to\\u2014a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Nick. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME> of the Wall Street Journal. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>, it seems to me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons. One was the risk of a wage\\u2013 price spiral. Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. This morning\\u2019s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a sub\\u20134 percent pace. Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency of the last three years. And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these two tail risks and that you\\u2019ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory, what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent? Are you really going to learn more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for\\u2014partly for the reasons that you say. You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down. Growth has been strong. The labor market is strong. We\\u2019re\\u2014what we\\u2019re trying to do is identify a place where we\\u2019re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level. So, overall, I think\\u2014I think people do believe\\u2014and, as you know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year. But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation moderates, as it\\u2014as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its variants. What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current instance? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Well, I\\u2014look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules. We consult them regularly. They\\u2019re in our, our Tealbook, and, and they\\u2019re in all the materials that we look at. But, you know, I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ve ever been at a\\u2014at a place where we were\\u2014where we were setting policy by them. And there\\u2014depending on the rule, it will tell you different things. There are many different formulations. Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is\\u2014so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if\\u2014holding all else equal\\u2014as inflation comes down. But that doesn\\u2019t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates\\u2014sorry\\u2014as inflation comes down. It doesn\\u2019t mean that at all, because, for one thing, we, we don\\u2019t know\\u2014we, we look at more than just the fed funds rate. We look at\\u2014broadly\\u2014financial conditions. But, in addition, we don\\u2019t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time. But that also doesn\\u2019t mean that we wait around for\\u2014to see, you know, the economy turn down, because that would be too late. So we\\u2019re really in a risk-management mode: of managing the risk\\u2014as I mentioned in my opening remarks\\u2014managing the risk that we move too soon and move too late. And I think to move, which is\\u2014which is where almost everyone on the Committee is\\u2014is in favor of, of moving rates down this year\\u2014but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Howard. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. Hi. Thanks, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I\\u2019d like you to, to key in on the use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still \\u201cremains elevated.\\u201d You\\u2019ve pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2 percent. So that implies that there\\u2019s some sort of intermediate step here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that inflation \\u201cremains elevated.\\u201d What\\u2019s the step-down from there? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, I, I don\\u2019t know that we\\u2019ve worked out the particulars\\u2014 statement language and that kind of thing. I would just say, if you look at\\u2014you know, look at where, where 12-month inflation is, and it\\u2019s, you know, it\\u2019s still well above\\u2014core is 2.9 percent, for example\\u201412-month\\u2014which is way down from where it was. Very, very positive development\\u2014very fast decline\\u2014and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue to come down. So, so that\\u2019s where\\u2014that\\u2019s where it is. But we\\u2019re, you know, we\\u2019re wanting to see, you know, more data. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. So, if I\\u2014if I could follow up on that, the statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn\\u2019t mention the other side of the mandate\\u2014a slide in employment. Would a slide in employment also bring you to the point of, of cutting rates? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yes. So let me say that we\\u2019re not looking for that. That\\u2019s not something we\\u2019re looking for. But, yes, if you think about, you know\\u2014in, in the base case, the economy is performing well\\u2014the labor market remains strong. If we saw an unexpected weakening in, in\\u2014certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner. Absolutely. And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things\\u2014would argue for moving later. In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth\\u2014solid growth\\u2014we have a strong labor market\\u2014we have inflation coming down\\u2014that\\u2019s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around. And in that case, what we\\u2019re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Claire. <NAME>CLAIRE JONES</NAME>. <NAME>CLAIRE JONES</NAME>, Financial Times. Just to circle back to the \\u201cgreater confidence\\u201d aspect of the statement, there\\u2019s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings. I\\u2019m just wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity or, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater confidence is? And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that \\u201cgreater confidence\\u201d threshold could be reached? Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we\\u2019re not\\u2014we\\u2019re not really at that stage. You know, we\\u2019re\\u2014 we\\u2019re\\u2014there was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did, you know, talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence of where people are, although it is\\u2014it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later. So, you know, we\\u2019re not\\u2014we\\u2019re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we weren\\u2019t actively considering, you know, a\\u2014moving, moving the federal funds rate down. I will say, there is a\\u2014there is a wide disparity\\u2014a healthy disparity\\u2014of views, and you see that in public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they\\u2019re released every five years. So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that\\u2019s actually essential for making good policy. We\\u2019re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other\\u2014 we, we compromise. And even though not everybody loves what we do, they\\u2019re able to\\u2014for the most part\\u2014able to join in. To me, that\\u2019s a well-functioning public institution. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Rachel. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME> from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like OpenTable data or office attendance. You\\u2019ve talked about vacancies in the past. And I\\u2019m wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that\\u2019s giving you the clearest picture of the economy\\u2014including on rents\\u2014if you could touch on that. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Including? <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME>. Rent. Rent costs. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah. Well, so we\\u2019re not\\u2014you know, it\\u2019s not the pandemic, so we can actually rely on more, more traditional forms. People are working. They\\u2019re getting wages, and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn\\u2019t say we\\u2019re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you point to rents. So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully. Which would be: Goods inflation\\u2014I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation. So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as measured, measured in PCE inflation? And we think that\\u2019s coming, and we know it\\u2019s coming. It\\u2019s just a question of when and, and how big it\\u2019ll be. So\\u2014but that\\u2019s in, in everyone\\u2019s forecast, I would say. So that will\\u2014that will help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably\\u2014it\\u2019s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort\\u2014and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some more time to run. You know, these\\u2014the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were. In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices. So there may be still a tailwind. We\\u2019ll find out with, with that. So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully, and\\u2014as you would imagine. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME>. I guess, just as a quick follow-up\\u2014do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more confidence? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, I wouldn\\u2019t\\u2014I wouldn\\u2019t say we\\u2019ve achieved that. And I, I think we have\\u2014we have a ways to go. Inflation is still\\u2014you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis. Twelve months is our, our target, certainly. I\\u2019m encouraged, and we\\u2019re encouraged by the progress. But, you know, we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re not\\u2014we\\u2019re not declaring victory at all at this point. We think we have a ways to go. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Steve. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You\\u2019ve said that you would know the neutral rate by its works. So I\\u2019m wondering what you could tell me\\u2014how do you believe the neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger? In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So it\\u2019s\\u2014I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the economy\\u2014you do see, for example, housing. You see the effects. You do. Your, your second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through\\u2014a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you\\u2019ve seen the\\u2014you know, that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply side to recover\\u2014I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So, no\\u2014we really do think that we\\u2019re having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it\\u2019s a\\u2014it\\u2019s a joint story. It\\u2019s a complicated story. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. It\\u2019s\\u2014so I think it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s\\u2014of course, you know that it\\u2019s not something you can identify with any precision. But if you\\u2014a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate\\u20145.3 percent, let\\u2019s say\\u2014and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation. If you do that\\u2014and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate\\u2014but that\\u2019s one I like to do. And, you know, you\\u2019re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality\\u2014of the neutral rate\\u2014you will. And\\u2014but at the same time, you look at the economy, and you say, \\u201cThis is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.\\u201d And, and you say, \\u201cWhat does that tell you about the neutral rate?\\u201d What\\u2019s happening, though, is, the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that, that won\\u2019t go on forever. So a lot of the growth we\\u2019re seeing is not\\u2014is\\u2014it isn\\u2019t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and demand. You\\u2019re getting, you know, more activity because of the\\u2014of labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Rich. <NAME>RICH MILLER</NAME>. Thank you\\u2014sorry. Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. You mentioned earlier we\\u2019re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Do you\\u2014do you think the labor market now is back to quote, unquote, \\u201cnormal\\u201d and that the\\u2014we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic? Even with today\\u2019s ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic levels. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal\\u2014but not totally back to normal. And you pointed to one or more of them. So I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages\\u2014wage increases, rather, are not quite back to where they\\u2014to where they would need to be in the longer run. I, I would look at it this way, though. The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens\\u2014it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s\\u2014you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that\\u2019s okay. That\\u2019s okay. But we do see\\u2014you saw today\\u2019s ECI reading\\u2014you know, the evidence is that, that wage increases are still at a healthy level\\u2014very healthy level\\u2014but they\\u2019re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated\\u2014given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation. It\\u2019s, it\\u2019s an ongoing process\\u2014a healthy one\\u2014 and, and, you know, I think we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re moving in the right direction. <NAME>RICH MILLER</NAME>. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically, you\\u2019re saying? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I think the, the labor market is\\u2014it\\u2014I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019d\\u2014it\\u2019s rebalancing. Clearly, that the\\u2014there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened\\u2014you remember 2021\\u2014you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just\\u2014it was everywhere\\u2014panic on the part of businesses\\u2014couldn\\u2019t, couldn\\u2019t find people. So, what\\u2019s happened is\\u2014we expected labor\\u2014the labor supply\\u2014labor market to come back quickly, and it didn\\u2019t. And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, \\u201cWell, maybe we won\\u2019t get it back.\\u201d And then 2023, we did, as you know\\u2014so labor force participation came back strongly in \\u201923, and so did immigration. Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic. So\\u2014and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to what is still a very strong labor market. It\\u2019s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it\\u2019s getting back into balance, and that\\u2019s what we want to see. And, you know, one great way to look at that is what\\u2019s happening with, with wage increases. And you see it now across the, the major things that we\\u2014that we track. It isn\\u2019t every quarter, but, overall, there\\u2019s a clear trend\\u2014still at high levels, but back down to where\\u2014what would be consistent with, with where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Chris. <NAME>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER</NAME>. Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Rich\\u2019s question. It sounded like you suggested that you\\u2019re not worried about faster growth so much\\u2014so wanted to see if you\\u2019re seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here. And it sounds like you\\u2019re saying you\\u2019re not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, I think that that is a risk\\u2014the risk that inflation would, would reaccelerate. I think the, the greater risk is that it would\\u2014that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019s, to me, more likely. Of course, if\\u2014if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would\\u2014we would have to respond to that, and that would\\u2014 that would be a surprise at this point. But I have to tell you, that\\u2019s why we keep our options open here and why we\\u2019re not, you know, rushing. So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you\\u2019ve had six good months\\u2014very good months\\u2014but what, what\\u2019s really going to \\u201cshake out\\u201d here? You know, where\\u2014what will\\u2014 when we look back, what will we see? Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are\\u2014that are one-off factors that won\\u2019t repeat themselves? We don\\u2019t think so. We don\\u2019t\\u2014you know, that\\u2019s not what we think, but that\\u2019s the question we are asking. We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that. <NAME>CHRISTOPHER RUGABER</NAME>. And just one quick follow-up\\u2014Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something you\\u2019re watching as well? And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence where things are going? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019ll just have to see. Yeah. We\\u2019ll\\u2014we look at those. Last year was a\\u2014was a, a surprise. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Mike. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>, Bloomberg Radio and Television. If you don\\u2019t want to use the term \\u201csoft landing,\\u201d would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now, the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have diminished very much? And you mentioned below\\u20132 percent inflation for\\u2014on a three-month basis, core PCE has been running at 1\\u00bd percent. And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, how to\\u2014your first question\\u2014how to describe where we are? So I guess I would just say this\\u2014executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market\\u20143.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We\\u2019ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent. That hasn\\u2019t happened in 50 years. So it\\u2019s a good labor market. And we\\u2019ve seen inflation come down. We\\u2019ve talked about that. So we\\u2019ve got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there\\u2019s more to come. So this is a\\u2014this is a good situation. Let\\u2019s be honest. This is a\\u2014this is a good economy. But what\\u2019s the outlook? That\\u2019s looking in the rearview\\u2014the outlook\\u2014we do expect growth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn\\u2019t happened, but we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned. Job creation has slowed. The base of job growth has narrowed. And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting, you know, getting down closer to target. It\\u2019s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer. But, overall, this is a pretty good picture. It, it is a good picture. Your second question was\\u2014sorry. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. Could you get inflation that is below target\\u2014end up with inflation below target, and you have to do something about that? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we\\u2014the thing is, we\\u2019re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once. We\\u2019re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent. And the same thing is true if we have a month or two of lower\\u2014and we have that now\\u2014of, of inflation that\\u2019s annualized at a\\u2014at a lower level\\u2014that wouldn\\u2019t be good. We\\u2019re not\\u2014you know, we\\u2019re not looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent. We\\u2019re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent. So if we do face those circumstances, then we\\u2019ll have to deal with that. I think\\u2014I think as of now, you know, the, the question, which\\u2014we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Edward. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME> from Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this. So, as I\\u2019ve\\u2014as I\\u2019ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is it, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner? And then when we do see that first rate cut, is that\\u2014should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut cycle, or is it a one-off? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I\\u2019ll point you to that language on your first question. We, we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that\\u2014with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down\\u2014the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context\\u2014current context, we\\u2019re going to be data dependent. We\\u2019re going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that. But that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s to be seen. So I wouldn\\u2019t call\\u2014you know, when you say\\u2014when you ask me about \\u201cin the near term,\\u201d I\\u2019m hearing that as March. I would say I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s\\u2014that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. And your second question is\\u2014 <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. On, on the\\u2014is this the start of a\\u2014when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle, or is it\\u2014could it just be a one-off? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know, that\\u2019s going to depend on the data. The whole thing is, this is going to depend on the data. We\\u2019re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks. And we\\u2019re going to make our decisions based on that. And it could wind up\\u2014you know, we\\u2019ll, we\\u2019ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and people will write down what they think. But, in the end, it\\u2019s really going to depend on how the economy evolves. We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower\\u2014for example, stronger inflation\\u2014more, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us to\\u2014if they happen\\u2014that would cause us to go faster or\\u2014and sooner. And that would be a weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation. Those are the kinds of things. So we\\u2019re just\\u2014we\\u2019re just going to be reacting to the data. That\\u2019s the\\u2014 that\\u2019s really the only way we can do this. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Victoria. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Hi. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME> with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth? You know, you\\u2019ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that\\u2019s consistent with 2 percent inflation. We\\u2019ve obviously seen, you know\\u2014you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it\\u2019s cooled a little bit but still sort of above what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors\\u2014the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about\\u2014or do you think that productivity growth will, will fade over time? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So this is a really interesting question. And I think\\u2014my, my own view is\\u2014I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off, and, and activity didn\\u2019t decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough of productivity. And then, over the last\\u2014you saw high productivity last year, in \\u201923. I think we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the\\u2014you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy. Is there\\u2014is there a case\\u2014will it be the case that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis? And I don\\u2019t know. I don\\u2019t know. What would it take? It would take\\u2014you know, people talk about AI, but I would\\u2014my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don\\u2019t\\u2014I\\u2019m not sure I see\\u2014work from home doesn\\u2019t seem like it\\u2019s a big productivity increase. Or AI, artificial intelligence\\u2014 generative it may be, but probably not in the short run\\u2014probably, maybe in the longer run. So I\\u2019m not\\u2014I\\u2019m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right\\u2014you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Right. So would that be behind why we\\u2019ve seen such strong growth, but we\\u2019ve also seen inflation fall\\u2014that maybe there\\u2019s just a higher level of productivity? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. That\\u2019s one way to look at it. Yeah. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Nancy. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-GENZER. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-Genzer with Marketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I\\u2019m wondering\\u2014how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates? And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So when we think about, you know\\u2014our, our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re targeting. We\\u2019re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things. Those are very important things for people\\u2019s lives. But they\\u2019re not\\u2014you know, those are not the things we\\u2019re targeting. We\\u2019re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt, because it\\u2019s a very interest-sensitive sector. On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing. You know, we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out. So there\\u2019s\\u2014there hasn\\u2019t been enough housing built. And these are not\\u2014these are not things that we have any tools to address. But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. It\\u2019s, it\\u2019s really rental inflation. You\\u2019re taking owners\\u2019 equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants. And you\\u2019re, you\\u2019re running that through the CPI calculation. Or the PCE [inflation] calculation\\u2014the one we look at. And what that\\u2019s telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time. It has to as long as that remains the case. <NAME>NANCY MARSHALL</NAME>-GENZER. And just real quick\\u2014what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job\\u2014the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is absolutely essential for people\\u2019s lives, most importantly for\\u2014well, not most importantly\\u2014most, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges\\u2014at the margins. And so someone\\u2014for someone like that, high inflation in the\\u2014in the necessities of life\\u2014right away, you\\u2019re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know, some scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get\\u2014it\\u2019s our job. It\\u2019s what society has asked us to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates. So that\\u2019s how we think about that. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Courtenay. <NAME>COURTENAY BROWN</NAME>. <NAME>COURTENAY BROWN</NAME> from Axios. Can you give us some insight into whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yes. So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well. And as the process has continued, you know, we\\u2019re getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we\\u2019re planning to begin in- depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those, those questions are all coming into scope now, and we\\u2019re focusing on them. But we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re at the beginning of that process, I would say. <NAME>COURTENAY BROWN</NAME>. Quick follow-up\\u2014is it the case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yes, we do\\u2014we see those as independent tools. And so they don\\u2019t\\u2014for example, if you\\u2019re\\u2014if you\\u2019re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases, that\\u2019s normalization, but from a strict monetary policy standpoint, you could say we\\u2019re loosening along with tightening. So that, that could happen. It\\u2019s not something we\\u2019re planning or thinking about, but right now, we\\u2019re thinking about getting to a place where\\u2014we\\u2019re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We\\u2019re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we\\u2019ll\\u2014we\\u2019ll be looking into that as a Committee starting in March. <NAME>COURTENAY BROWN</NAME>. Thanks. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Simon. <NAME>SIMON RABINOVITCH</NAME>. <NAME>SIMON RABINOVITCH</NAME> with the Economist. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You\\u2019ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build up confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn\\u2019t start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either. Roughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be\\u2014to be confident? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I\\u2019m, I\\u2019m not in a position to put a number on it. I\\u2019m just going to say\\u2014and it\\u2019s not that we don\\u2019t have any confidence. We, we have growing confidence, but not to the point where we\\u2014where we feel like\\u2014it\\u2019s a highly consequential decision to start the process of, of dialing back on restriction. And we want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down\\u2014it gives us the ability to do that. We think that\\u2019s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we\\u2019ve made a lot of progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way. That\\u2019s how we\\u2019re thinking about it. In terms of when that\\u2019ll be, you know, that, that\\u2019ll all come out of our communications, and, you know, we won\\u2019t\\u2014we won\\u2019t keep that a secret. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Evan. <NAME>EVAN RYSER</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>EVAN RYSER</NAME> with MNI Market News. Can you explain a little bit more on what you\\u2019re considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Not a decision that we\\u2019ve made, but I, I wouldn\\u2019t think we\\u2019d, we\\u2019d be\\u2014we wouldn\\u2019t be taking a position that it\\u2019s got to go to zero. I mean, if it\\u2014if it were to stabilize at a different level\\u2014but that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s not a decision that we\\u2019ve made. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up, and the Committee will get into\\u2014get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let\\u2019s say, year or so. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Greg. <NAME>GREG ROBB</NAME>. Thanks. <NAME>GREG ROBB</NAME> from MarketWatch. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>, I want to change gears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that\\u2019s been going on for the last nine months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates had said that they probably wouldn\\u2019t want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about that. Do you want another term\\u2014you\\u2019ve had\\u2014on the Fed? What, what\\u2019s your stance on that? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I don\\u2019t have a stance on that. It\\u2019s not something I\\u2019m focused on. [We\\u2019re] focused on doing our jobs. We have\\u2014this year is going to be a highly consequential year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy. And we\\u2019re, all of us, very buckled down, focused on doing our jobs. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jennifer. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME>. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME> with Yahoo Finance. As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over the past six months. And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4 percent, compared to that six-month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it\\u2019s been over the last six months for the next six months? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I\\u2014you know, we\\u2019re going to do\\u2014we\\u2019ll update our, our inflation forecasts at the next meeting. You referred to the December meeting. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019s, you know, three months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we\\u2019ve gotten. So, look, as I mentioned, we\\u2019re going to be reacting to the data. If, if we get\\u2014if we get very strong inflation data and it, it kicks back up, then it\\u2019ll\\u2014then we\\u2019ll go slower or later or both. If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the\\u2014that, that would tell us that, that we could go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we\\u2019re just going to be\\u2014but, of course, we\\u2019ll weigh that with all the other factors. We\\u2019re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME>. But just to follow\\u2014if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive. Would that mean you\\u2019d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Well, I think if we\\u2014if we came to the view that, that inflation were\\u2014that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in \\u201cPCE world\\u201d\\u2014if we came to\\u2014if that\\u2019s\\u2014if we thought that is really where we\\u2019re going to be, then, yes, our policy would be in a different place. It would. But, you know, that\\u2019s the whole point is, we\\u2019re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where\\u2014that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Daniel. <NAME>DANIEL AVIS</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>DANIEL AVIS</NAME>, Agence France-Presse. I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just wonder\\u2014is it fair to say that they\\u2019re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent months? And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that? And what challenges do you see, going forward? Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, so it\\u2019s been\\u2014it\\u2019s been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low\\u2014very low, historically low\\u2014for a couple of years. And\\u2014but, nonetheless, that\\u2019s been the case. And we\\u2019ve asked ourselves why that is. And, you know, one obvious answer\\u2014we don\\u2019t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this\\u2014is\\u2014but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So prices went up much more than 2 percent for year\\u2014per year for a couple of years. And people are going to the store, and they\\u2019re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago\\u2014three years ago. And they\\u2019re not happy about it. And it\\u2019s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price\\u2014the prices they\\u2019re paying are still high. So that, that is what\\u2014that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy. And they\\u2019re, they\\u2019re right to be unhappy. You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It\\u2019s why we need to do our jobs\\u2014so that people don\\u2019t have to deal with things like this. In terms of [surveys]\\u2014you\\u2019re right. In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of\\u2014you\\u2019ve seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the economy. I guess that\\u2019s a good thing. That can\\u2014that can support spending\\u2014can support economic activity. There\\u2019s some evidence of that. But it is\\u2014it is a fact that we have seen, you know, a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they\\u2019ve been at various times. But it\\u2019s\\u2014they certainly have come up. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Bryan. <NAME>BRYAN MENA</NAME>. Thank you for taking our questions. <NAME>BRYAN MENA</NAME>, CNN Business. Committee members have said they\\u2019d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So did any members say they\\u2019ve learned anything not reflected in the data? Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn\\u2019t been captured in the data yet? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Well, yes. I\\u2019m, I\\u2019m a big believer that\\u2014yes. So we, we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like you\\u2014I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies\\u2014individual companies\\u2014individual management teams\\u2014and then building out from that. And so, starting with GDP data is\\u2014and working into what\\u2019s actually affecting people\\u2019s lives is\\u2014is challenging. It\\u2019s very hard. So I, I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks have really the best network of anyone. In all their Districts, they\\u2019re talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all\\u2014you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back\\u2014that\\u2019s what goes into the Beige Book. But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during the outlook go-around, they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cIn my District . . .\\u201d And they\\u2019ll talk about 100 conversations they\\u2014not\\u2014they won\\u2019t talk\\u2014they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that they\\u2019ve had with people of all different walks. And it\\u2019s\\u2014I personally find it very helpful in understanding what\\u2019s going on. And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. <NAME>BRYAN MENA</NAME>. Did any of them\\u2014did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they\\u2019ve heard from, like, their District? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yes. I mean, if you\\u2014if you look back at the last\\u2014not this Beige Book, but the one before, it was more\\u2014there was a lot of \\u201cslower activity.\\u201d I think that, that what you\\u2019re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit. You\\u2019re hearing\\u2014not, not in every District and not every, every person that we talk to, but you\\u2019re\\u2014overall, it feels like you\\u2019re hearing things picking up at the margin. So that\\u2019s what comes through. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Let\\u2019s go to <NAME>JEFF COX</NAME> for the last question. <NAME>JEFF COX</NAME>. Thank you, sir. <NAME>JEFF COX</NAME> from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all together: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might? That, you know\\u2014you\\u2019re in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you\\u2019re more\\u2014you\\u2019re more tilted towards that. And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I\\u2019m not so worried about that. You know, it\\u2019s\\u2014again, we\\u2019ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in unemployment, and there\\u2019s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if it\\u2019s going to continue. So I, I am\\u2014you know, I think\\u2014I think declining inflation\\u2014continued declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we\\u2019re looking at. Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong, too. We don\\u2019t have a growth mandate. We\\u2019ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a, a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two\\u2014of those two mandates. Thank you very much.\",\n          \"<NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August. We\\u2019re committed to maintaining our economy\\u2019s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by \\u00bd percentage point. This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of 2 percent over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool. Payroll job gains averaged 116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, four-tenths higher than projected in June. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight. Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today\\u2019s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by \\u00bd percentage point to 4\\u00be percent to 5 percent. This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks. These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\\u2014maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum- employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Steve. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our questions. In July, you said you weren\\u2019t necessarily thinking about a 50. You didn\\u2019t want to be specific, but you said you weren\\u2019t thinking about a 50. The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected. Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent. So what changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market? And I guess, should we expect more 50s in the months ahead? And based on what should we make that call? Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [Laughter] Let me jump in. So, since the last meeting\\u2014okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in. We\\u2019ve had the two employment reports, July and August. We\\u2019ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe\\u2014that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we\\u2019re getting may be artificially high and will be revised down. You know that. We\\u2019ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data collected in] the Beige Book. So we took all of those, and we went into blackout. And we thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s how we made our decision. So that\\u2019s one question. What was the second and third? <NAME>STEVE LIESMAN</NAME>. How do we make the\\u2014sorry, thank you, sir. How do we figure out in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call? Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Sure. So a couple things. A good place to start is the\\u2014is the SEP, but let me start with what I said, which was that we\\u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks. If you look at the SEP, you\\u2019ll, you\\u2019ll see that it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that\\u2019s more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be. And that process will take place over time. There\\u2019s nothing in the\\u2014in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to get this done. This, this process evolves over time. Of course, that\\u2019s a projection. That\\u2019s a baseline projection. We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do will depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that\\u2019s appropriate. We can go slower if that\\u2019s appropriate. We can pause if that\\u2019s appropriate. But that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s what we are contemplating. Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where\\u2014what the Committee is thinking today\\u2014what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take\\u2014you know, are realized. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Let\\u2019s go to Chris. <NAME>CHRIS RUGABER</NAME>. Hi. <NAME>CHRIS RUGABER</NAME> at Associated Press. Thank you. The projections show that the Fed\\u2014Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year. So does that suggest that you see rates as restrictive for that entire period? Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you\\u2019d like to avoid? Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little bit higher? Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I think it would\\u2014the way I would really characterize it is this: I think people write down their estimate, individuals do. I think every single person on the Committee, if you asked them, what\\u2019s your level of certainty around that, they would say there\\u2019s a wide range where that could fall. So I think we don\\u2019t know. There are model-based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But, realistically, we know it by its works. So that leaves us in a place where we\\u2019ll be\\u2014where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we\\u2019ll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that. And that\\u2019ll be guiding us in our thinking about the question that we\\u2019re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one? We know\\u2014if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3\\u00bd percent and inflation was 4.2 percent. Today, unemployment is up to 4.2 percent; inflation\\u2019s down to a few tenths above 2. So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even. And this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral, and we\\u2019ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time. What you have is our individual\\u2014accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Howard. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME> with Reuters. How close was this in terms of the decision? You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think. Was the weight clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I think we had a good\\u2014a good discussion. You know, if you go back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn\\u2019t address the question of the size of the cut and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout. And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity of\\u2014excellent discussion today. I think there was also broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on. So I would add, though, look at the SEP. All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year. All 19. That\\u2019s a big change from June, right? Seven of the\\u2014seven of them wrote down three or more and\\u2014sorry, 17 of the 19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts. So, you know, there is a dissent, and there\\u2019s a range of views, but there\\u2019s actually a lot of common ground as well. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. Follow-up to that. Now that this is in the books, can you give us some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here? Would you expect this to be running every other meeting once we get into next year? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned. There\\u2019s no sense that the Committee feels it\\u2019s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this, and that\\u2019s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence\\u2014confidence that inflation is, is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can, you know, make a good, strong start. But\\u2014and I\\u2019m very pleased that we did. To me, the logic of this, both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear. But I think we\\u2019re going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go. <NAME>HOWARD SCHNEIDER</NAME>. Thank you. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jeanna. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>JEANNA SMIALEK</NAME>, New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there. Obviously, historically, when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn\\u2019t typically just stop\\u2014it continues increasing. And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the labor market stabilizing, sort of what\\u2019s the mechanism there? And what do you see as the risks? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there. You can say that about the whole economy. The U.S. economy is in good shape. It\\u2019s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there. That\\u2019s, that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Sorry\\u2014Nick. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME> of the Wall Street Journal. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>, does today\\u2019s action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data, or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Okay, multiple questions in there. So I would say we don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re behind. We do not think\\u2014we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. So it\\u2019s, it\\u2019s a strong move. Sorry, your other question was? <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting? Or is this about the level of the funds rate\\u2014the high nominal level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you\\u2019re trying to maintain equilibrium? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I think it\\u2019s about\\u2014we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment. We\\u2019ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate. We\\u2019ve waited. Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times. We\\u2019ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent. So I think that is what enables us to take this, this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, \\u201cOh, this is the new pace.\\u201d You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case. Of course, what happens will happen. So, so, in the base case, what you see is\\u2014look at the SEP, you see cuts moving along. The sense of this is we\\u2019re recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level. And we\\u2019re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given developments in the economy and the base case. The economy can develop in a way that would cause us to go faster or slower, but that\\u2019s what the base case is. <NAME>NICK TIMIRAOS</NAME>. And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff. With a larger cut today, is there any\\u2014should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach \\u201cend state\\u201d on the balance sheet policy? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable. They haven\\u2019t come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility]. So I think what that tells you is, we\\u2019re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this at all. We know that these two things can happen side by side. In a sense, they\\u2019re both a form of normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting rates. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Colby. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME>. Thank you. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME> with the Financial Times. Just following up on Jeanna\\u2019s question on rising unemployment. Is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too? And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not\\u2014why should we not expect a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So I think what we\\u2019re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and\\u2014but they\\u2019re still at a level\\u2014 the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment. So you\\u2019re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that. So what\\u2019s driving it? Clearly, clearly payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching. Many\\u2014 By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, \\u201917. So the labor market bears close\\u2014bears close watching, and we\\u2019ll be giving it that. But ultimately, we think\\u2014we believe, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing, and that will support the labor market. In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP\\u2014all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace. So that should also support the labor market over time. So\\u2014but again, we\\u2019re\\u2014it bears watching. And we\\u2019re watching. <NAME>COLBY SMITH</NAME>. And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to happen, wouldn\\u2019t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we\\u2019re\\u2014that\\u2019s\\u2014you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin to recalibrate and we\\u2019re\\u2014as you know, we\\u2019re not seeing rising claims, we\\u2019re not seeing rising layoffs, we\\u2019re not seeing that, and we\\u2019re not hearing that from companies that that\\u2019s something that\\u2019s getting ready to happen. So we\\u2019re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is\\u2014there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when\\u2014is when it\\u2019s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs. There\\u2019s some lore on that. So that\\u2019s the situation we\\u2019re in. We have, in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we\\u2019ll be watching\\u2014and that\\u2019ll be one of the factors that we consider. Of course, we\\u2019re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME> with Bloomberg TV and Radio. To follow up on that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market? You\\u2019re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a higher unemployment rate. Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style\\u2014 rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019re going to be watching all of the data, right? So if\\u2014as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by, by cutting faster. We\\u2019re also going to be looking at our other mandate, though. We are more\\u2014we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time. So\\u2014and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening. <NAME>MICHAEL MCKEE</NAME>. I\\u2019m just curious as to how sensitive you\\u2019ll be to the labor market, since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant amount of monetary easing to just maintain it. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, you know, what I would say is, we don\\u2019t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent. But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as\\u2014take a step back, what have we been trying to achieve? We\\u2019re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re trying to do. And I think you can take today\\u2019s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Rachel. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME> from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You\\u2019re describing this view that you don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re behind when it comes to the job market. Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be most helpful in the discussions at this meeting? You\\u2019ve mentioned a couple, but would you be able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job market now? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Sure. So we\\u2019ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably. You\\u2019re at 4.2 percent. That\\u2019s, you know\\u2014I know it\\u2019s higher than we were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back over the sweep of the years, that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s a low. That\\u2019s a very healthy unemployment rate. And anything in the low 4s is, is a really\\u2014is a good labor market. So that\\u2019s one thing. Participation is at high levels. It\\u2019s, you know\\u2014we\\u2019ve had\\u2014we\\u2019re right\\u2014adjusted for demographics for aging, participation\\u2019s at pretty high levels. That\\u2019s a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what would be their\\u2014wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they\\u2019re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is. So we feel good about that. Vacancies over\\u2014per unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level. It\\u2019s not as high as it was. That number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person. As measured, it\\u2019s now below\\u2014it\\u2019s around one. But that\\u2019s still\\u2014that\\u2019s still a very good number, I would say. You know, quits have come back down to normal levels. I mean, I could go on and on. There are many, many employment indicators. What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn\\u2019t the level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the downside risks to employment have increased. And, and because we have been patient and held our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we\\u2019re now in a very good position to manage the risks to both of our goals. <NAME>RACHEL SIEGEL</NAME>. And what do you expect to learn between now and November that will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know, more data, the usual. Don\\u2019t look for anything else. We\\u2019ll see another labor report. We\\u2019ll see another jobs report. I think we get a\\u2014we might, actually\\u2014 we get two\\u2014we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the Friday before the meeting. So\\u2014and inflation data. We\\u2019ll get all this data. We\\u2019ll be watching. You know, it\\u2019s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think, what\\u2019s the right thing to do? Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of our goals over time? So that\\u2019s what it is, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ll be doing. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Neil. <NAME>NEIL IRWIN</NAME>. Thanks. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>NEIL IRWIN</NAME> with Axios. We\\u2019ve only been running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months. Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be\\u2014would you be content if we were to kind of stick at that level? And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather than job losses. Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor market cooling will have to come through job losses? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So, on the job creation, it depends on\\u2014it depends on the inflows, right? So, if you\\u2019re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you\\u2019re creating 100,000 jobs, you\\u2019re going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what\\u2019s the trend underlying the volatility of people coming into the country. We understand there\\u2019s been quite an influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s allowed the unemployment rate to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what\\u2019s happening on the supply side. On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss. And yes, I mean, I think we are\\u2014it\\u2019s hard to know that\\u2014you can\\u2019t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we\\u2019re very close to that point, if not at it, so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it\\u2019s been\\u2014 it\\u2019s been a great ride down. I mean, we\\u2019ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Edward. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. Thanks, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME> with Fox Business. So we\\u2019ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3\\u00bd, maybe under 4 percent. There\\u2019s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near- zero federal funds rate, and some think we\\u2019re heading in that direction again. What\\u2019s the likelihood that cheap money is now the norm? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So this is a question\\u2014and you mean after we get through all of this? It\\u2019s just\\u2014great question that we just, we can only speculate about. Intuitively, most\\u2014many, many people anyway, would say we\\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates\\u2014long-term bonds trading at negative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate was\\u2014might even be negative, so\\u2014and it was\\u2014people were issuing debt at negative rates. It seems that\\u2019s so far away now. My own sense is that we\\u2019re not going back to that. But, you know, honestly, we\\u2019re going to find out. But, you know, it feels\\u2014it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I don\\u2019t\\u2014I just don\\u2019t think we know. It\\u2019s\\u2014again, we only know it by its works. <NAME>EDWARD LAWRENCE</NAME>. And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and, you know, it\\u2019s always the same. We\\u2019re always\\u2014we\\u2019re always going into this meeting, in particular, and asking, what\\u2019s the right thing to do for the people we serve? And we do that, and we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it. And it\\u2019s\\u2014that\\u2019s always what it is. It\\u2019s never about anything else. Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag. So, nonetheless, this is what we do. Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And, if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the mind, and, you know, it\\u2019s something we all take very, very seriously. We don\\u2019t put up any other filters. I think if you start doing that, I don\\u2019t know where you stop. And so we just don\\u2019t do that. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jo Ling. <NAME>JO LING KENT</NAME>. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I\\u2019m <NAME>JO LING KENT</NAME> with CBS News. My first question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the American people, with this unusually large rate cut? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place, and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape. So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the U.S. economy. And we\\u2019ll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been\\u2014the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control. We\\u2019re, we\\u2019re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time. <NAME>JO LING KENT</NAME>. Just have a follow-up to that. Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, we\\u2019re not. So inflation, you know\\u2014what we say is we want inflation\\u2014the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. And, you know, we\\u2019re not really\\u2014we\\u2019re close, but we\\u2019re not really at 2 percent. And I think we\\u2019re going to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we\\u2019re certainly not doing\\u2014we\\u2019re not saying \\u201cmission accomplished\\u201d or anything like that. But I have to say, though, we\\u2019re encouraged by the progress that we have made. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Catarina. <NAME>CATARINA SARAIVA</NAME>. Hi. <NAME>CATARINA SARAIVA</NAME> with Bloomberg News. I just would love to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we\\u2019ve seen in housing inflation. You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is? Yeah. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So housing inflation is the\\u2014is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they\\u2019re not rolling over\\u2014the leases that are rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high. So, you know, it\\u2019s been slower than we expected. I think we now understand that it\\u2019s going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this. But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it\\u2019s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals. So that\\u2019s\\u2014I think we understand that now, but I don\\u2019t think the outcome is in doubt again. As long as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt. So I would say it\\u2019s\\u2014the rest of the portfolio\\u2014or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well. You know, they\\u2019re all\\u2014they all have some volatility. We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we\\u2019ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too. <NAME>CATARINA SARAIVA</NAME>. Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more. What\\u2019s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. The housing market, it\\u2019s hard to\\u2014it\\u2019s a game that\\u2014the housing market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates. People don\\u2019t want to sell their homes. So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance. As rates come down, people will start to move more, and that\\u2019s probably beginning to happen already. But remember, when that happens, you\\u2019ve got a seller, but you\\u2019ve also got a new buyer in many cases. So it\\u2019s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make. I mean, the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing. And so it\\u2019s going to be challenging. It\\u2019s hard to find\\u2014to zone lots that are in places where people want to live. It\\u2019s\\u2014all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and, you know, where are we going to get the supply? And this is not something that the Fed can, can really fix. But I think, as we normalize rates, you\\u2019ll see the housing market normalize. And, I mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that\\u2019s the best thing we can do for house holders. And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Victoria. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME>. Hi. <NAME>VICTORIA GUIDA</NAME> with Politico. Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and I\\u2019m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too much comes from the fact that you\\u2019re starting to act now and that\\u2019s going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong. And then, also, if I could, following up on Nick\\u2019s question, do you see today\\u2019s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that you didn\\u2019t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So you\\u2019re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall economy. You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace. If you look at forecasters or talk to companies, they\\u2019ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too. So there\\u2019s no sense\\u2014the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know, business people who are actually out there doing business. So I think, you know, I think our move is timely. I do. And, as I said, you can\\u2014you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a commitment to make sure that we don\\u2019t fall behind. So you\\u2019re really asking about\\u2014your second question, you\\u2019re asking about July. And I guess if you ask if we\\u2019d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut? We might well have. We didn\\u2019t make that decision, but we might well have. I think that\\u2019s not\\u2014you know, that doesn\\u2019t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let\\u2019s look, you know\\u2014at this meeting we\\u2019re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report, the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things that I mentioned. We\\u2019re looking at all of those things, and we\\u2019re asking ourselves, what\\u2019s the right\\u2014what\\u2019s the policy stance we need to move to? We knew\\u2014it\\u2019s clear that we\\u2014clearly, literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it\\u2019s time to move. It\\u2019s just how big\\u2014how fast do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward. So this decision we made today had broad support on the Committee, and I\\u2019ve discussed the path ahead. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Elizabeth. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME>. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME> with ABC News. Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement. How much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Very hard for me to say. That\\u2019s\\u2014from our standpoint, I can\\u2019t really speak to mortgage rates. I will say that\\u2019ll depend on how the economy evolves. Our intention, though, is\\u2014we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive. We think that it\\u2019s time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that\\u2019s more neutral, rather than restrictive. We expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today. And as\\u2014if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs. We can\\u2019t see\\u2014we can\\u2019t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing\\u2014going to be doing. <NAME>ELIZABETH SCHULZE</NAME>. What\\u2019s your message to households who are frustrated that home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high? What do you say to those households? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest\\u2014we had a burst of inflation. Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It\\u2019s not something that people experience as pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored. And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they\\u2019re not thinking about inflation anymore. That\\u2019s where everyone wants to be, is back to what\\u2019s inflation, you know? Just keep it low, keep it stable. We\\u2019re restoring that. So what we\\u2019re going through now really restores\\u2014it will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don\\u2019t have to deal with inflation. So that\\u2019s what\\u2019s been going on, and I think we\\u2019ve made real progress. I completely\\u2014we don\\u2019t tell people how to think about the economy, of course. And, of course, people are [still] experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation. And we understand that\\u2019s painful. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Greg. <NAME>GREG ROBB</NAME>. Hi, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>GREG ROBB</NAME> from Marketwatch.com. I was wondering if you could go through\\u2014you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was like an open thought of 25 or 50\\u2014you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50. I would sort of argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day. I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this. But, I mean, could you talk\\u2014 would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a 50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out? It was a really small probability of a 50 point cut. Does that play in your consideration at all? Just talk a little bit about that. Thank you. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019ll do. And that\\u2019s what we did today. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Simon. <NAME>SIMON RABINOVITCH</NAME>. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>SIMON RABINOVITCH</NAME> with the Economist. You\\u2019ve mentioned how closely you\\u2019re watching the labor market, but you also noted that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions. Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate? And given the SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, including the payroll numbers. We\\u2019re not discarding those. I mean, we\\u2019ll certainly look at those, but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to. There isn\\u2019t a bright line. You know, it will be\\u2014the unemployment rate\\u2019s very important, of course, but there isn\\u2019t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another. We\\u2019ll look at\\u2014each meeting, we\\u2019ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we\\u2019ll make decisions about, is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals? So I can\\u2019t\\u2014I can\\u2019t say we have a bright line in mind. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. <NAME>MATT EGAN</NAME>. <NAME>MATT EGAN</NAME>. Thanks, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>MATT EGAN</NAME> from CNN. I know that you discussed earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in. But, in general, can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed decisions on interest rates? Because that\\u2019s something that former President Trump, who obviously appointed you, has previously suggested. And I know the Fed is designed to be independent, but why? Can you tell the public why you view that as so important? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. Sure. So countries that are\\u2014democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office. So that\\u2019s the idea, is that\\u2014 you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation. And so we\\u2019re, we\\u2019re not\\u2014we do our work to serve all Americans. We\\u2019re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It\\u2019s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that\\u2019s how the other central banks are set up, too. It\\u2019s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public and I hope\\u2014and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Kyle. <NAME>KYLE CAMPBELL</NAME>. <NAME>KYLE CAMPBELL</NAME> for American Banker. Thanks for taking the questions, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask you about. First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the changes to the Basel III endgame. I\\u2019m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you\\u2019re looking for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach. And then yesterday, other banking regulators\\u2014 <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know what, hold the second question. <NAME>KYLE CAMPBELL</NAME>. Okay. Sure. <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. We\\u2019ll give you the second question. So the answer to your question is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them. So, yes, that is\\u2014that\\u2019s happening with my support. <NAME>KYLE CAMPBELL</NAME>. Is there a date for that\\u2014 <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. That\\u2019s not a final proposal, though, you understand. We\\u2019re putting them out for comment. We\\u2019re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.

But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment, and then, you know, it\\u2019ll\\u2014the comments will come back 60 days later, and we\\u2019ll dive into them, and we\\u2019ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year. <NAME>KYLE CAMPBELL</NAME>. Right. And then, yesterday. there were merger reform finalizations from the other bank regulators. What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. You know, I would\\u2014I would bounce that question to Vice Chair Barr. It\\u2019s a good question, but I don\\u2019t have that today. Thanks. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Jennifer, for the last question. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME>. Thank you, <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME> with Yahoo Finance. You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly balanced. Given what you\\u2019ve said, though, today, I\\u2019m curious, are you more worried about the job market and growth than inflation? Are they not roughly balanced? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. No, I think\\u2014I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced. So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation. We had a historically tight labor market, historically tight. There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market. And we had inflation way above target. So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation. And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation. Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market. You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity. So what that tells you is, it\\u2019s time to change our stance. So we did that. The sense of the change in the stance is that we\\u2019re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral. And today was\\u2014I think we made a good strong start on that. I think it was the right decision, and I think it should send a signal that we, you know, that we\\u2019re committed to coming up with a good outcome here. <NAME>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER</NAME>. Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that could tip it into recession? <NAME>CHAIR POWELL</NAME>. I don\\u2019t think so. I don\\u2019t\\u2014there\\u2019s\\u2014as I look\\u2014well, let me look at it this way: I don\\u2019t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a recession\\u2014sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay? I don\\u2019t see that. You see\\u2014you see growth at a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that\\u2019s, that\\u2019s still at very solid levels. So, so I don\\u2019t really see that, no. Thank you. <NAME>MICHELLE SMITH</NAME>. Thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
